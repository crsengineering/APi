Seismic accelerometer using Raspberry Pi

Nowdays you can find several projects where you can collect accelerometer data using cheap MEMS sensors and Raspberry Pi.
There are several issues if comparing these solutions with instruments for seismic purposes (such sensor type, timing and non-standard protocols).
At the same time there are several people adding MEMS accelerometer to Raspberry Pi and saying "I made a seismic instrument, so why spend so much money for a professional one?".
Be sure there is a reason because a professional instrument is much more expensive than a MEMS accelerometer mounted on Raspberry Pi...
The goal is to create a cost-effective seismic instrument explaining meanwhile differences with professional one.
